<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: Manifold learning algorithms aim to map high-dimensional data into lower dimensions while preserving local and global structure, however popular methods distort distances between points in the low-dimensional space. In this talk, I present a bottom-up manifold learning framework that constructs low-distortion local views of a dataset in lower dimensions and registers these to obtain a global embedding. Our global alignment formulation enables tearing manifolds so as to embed them into their intrinsic dimension, including manifolds without boundary and non-orientable manifolds. To quantitatively evaluate the quality of low-dimensional embeddings, we present a new strong and weak notion of global distortion. We show that Riemannian Gradient Descent (RGD) converges to a global embedding with guaranteed low global distortion. Compared to competing manifold learning and data visualization approaches, our framework achieves the lowest local and global distortion, as well as the lowest reconstruction error in downstream decoding tasks, on synthetic and real-world neuroscience datasets.

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Network GPS - A Perturbative Theory of Network Dynamics</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: Universal network characteristics, such as the scale-free degree distribution and the small world phenomena, are the bread and butter of network science. But how do we translate such topological findings into an understanding of the system's dynamic behavior: for instance, how does the small world structure impact the patterns of flow in the system? Or how does the presence of hubs affect the distribution of influence? In essence, whether its communicable diseases, genetic regulation or the spread of failures in an infrastructure network, these questions touch on the patterns of information spread in the network. It all begins with a local perturbation, such as a sudden disease outbreak or a local power failure, which then propagates to impact all other nodes. The challenge is that the resulting spatio-temporal propagation patterns are diverse and unpredictable - indeed a Zoo of spreading patterns - that seem to be only loosely connected to the network topology. We show that we can tame this zoo, by exposing a systematic translation of topological elements into their dynamic outcome, allowing us to navigate the network, and, most importantly - to expose a deep universality behind the seemingly diverse dynamics.</p>

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Connecting the dots: Leveraging GSP to learn graphs from nodal observations</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: The talk will provide an overview of graph signal processing (GSP)-based methods designed to learn an unknown network from nodal observations. Using signals to learn a graph is a central problem in network science and statistics, with results going back more than 50 years. The main goal of the talk is threefold: i) explaining in detail fundamental GSP-based methods and comparing those with classical methods in statistics, ii) putting forth a number of GSP-based formulations and algorithms able to address scenarios with a range of different operating conditions, and iii) briefly introducing generalizations to more challenging setups, including multi-layer graphs and learning in the presence of hidden nodal variables. Our graph learning algorithms will be designed as solutions to judiciously formulated constrained-optimization sparse-recovery problems. Critical to this approach is the codification of GSP concepts such as signal smoothness and graph stationarity into tractable constraints. Last but not least, while the focus will be on the so-called network association problem (a setup where observations from all nodes are available), the problem of network tomography (where some nodes remain unobserved, and which can be related to latent-variable graphical lasso) will also be discussed.</p>

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Signal processing on graphs and complexes</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: Graph signal processing (GSP) tries to device appropriate tools to process signals supported on graphs by generalizing classical methods from signal processing of time-series and images -- such as smoothing, filtering and supported on the nodes of graphs.  Typically, this involves leveraging the structure of the graph as encoded in the spectral properties of the graph Laplacian. In applications such as traffic network analysis, however, the signals of interest are naturally defined on the edges of a graph, rather than on the nodes. After a very brief recap of the central ideas of GSP, we examine why the standard tools from GSP may not be suitable for the analysis of such edge signals.  More specifically, we discuss how the underlying notion of a 'smooth signal' inherited from (the typically considered variants of) the graph Laplacian are not suitable when dealing with edge signals that encode flows.  To overcome this limitation we devise signal processing tools based on the Hodge-Laplacian and the associated discrete Hodge Theory for simplicial (and cellular) complexes.  We discuss applications of these ideas for signal smoothing, semi-supervised and active learning for edge-flows on discrete (or discretized) spaces.</p>

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Geometric Deep learning for Drug Discovery</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: Drug discovery is a very long and expensive process, taking on average more than 10 years and costing $2.5B to develop a new drug. Artificial intelligence has the potential to significantly accelerate the process of drug discovery by extracting evidence from a huge amount of biomedical data and hence revolutionizes the entire pharmaceutical industry. In particular, graph representation learning and geometric deep learning--a fast growing topic in the machine learning and data mining community focusing on deep learning for graph-structured and 3D data---has seen great opportunities for drug discovery as many data in the domain are represented as graphs or 3D structures (e.g. molecules, proteins, biomedical knowledge graphs). In this talk, I will introduce our recent progress on geometric deep learning for drug discovery and also a newly released open-source machine learning platform for drug discovery, called TorchDrug. </p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Speaker Bio</b>: Jian Tang is currently an assistant professor at Mila-Quebec AI Institute and also at Computer Science Department and Business School of University of Montreal.  He is a Canada CIFAR AI Research Chair. His main research interests are graph representation learning, graph neural networks, geometric deep learning, deep generative models, knowledge graphs and drug discovery. During his PhD, he was awarded with the best paper in ICML2014; in 2016, he was nominated for the best paper award in the top data mining conference World Wide Web (WWW); in 2020, he is awarded with Amazon and Tencent Faculty Research Award. He is one of the most representative researchers in the growing field of graph representation learning and has published a set of representative works in this field such as LINE and RotatE. His work LINE on node representation learning has been widely recognized and is the most cited paper at the WWW conference between 2015 and 2019.

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Modeling physical structure and dynamics using graph-based machine learning</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: This talk presents various ways complex physical objects and dynamics can be modeled using graph-based machine learning. Graph neural networks and Transformers have grown rapidly in popularity in recent years, and much of the progress has been driven by applications which demand representations and computations which are not well-supported by more traditional deep learning methods. Here we'll explore learning to simulate fluids and non-rigid materials, as well as learning probabilistic generative models of 3D objects and molecules, focusing on how the model choices and innovations were motivated by the structure of the problem and data. The goal of the talk is to emphasize the rich interface between graph-based machine learning and problems that arise in physical settings, and offer practical prescriptions for applying graph-based machine learning to other physical domains.</p>

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Federated Learning in Big Data over Networks</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: Many important application domains generate distributed collections of heterogeneous local datasets. These local datasets are related via an intrinsic network structure that arises from domain-specific notions of similarity between local datasets. Networked federated learning aims at learning a tailored local model for each local dataset. We formulate networked federated learning using the concept of generalized total variation (GTV) minimization as a regularizer. This formulation unifies and considerably extends recent approaches to federated multi-task learning. We derive precise conditions on the local models as well on their network structure such that our algorithm learns nearly optimal local models. Our analysis reveals an interesting interplay between the (information-) geometry of local models and the (cluster-) geometry of their network.</p>

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Causal Inference on Networks to Characterize Disinformation Narrative Propagation</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: The weaponization of digital communications and social media to conduct disinformation campaigns at immense scale, speed, and reach presents new challenges to identify and counter hostile influence operations (IOs).  This talk presents the causal inference approach used as part of an end-to-end framework to automate detection of disinformation narratives, networks, and influential actors. The framework integrates natural language processing, machine learning, graph analytics, and a network causal inference approach to quantify the impact of individual actors in spreading IO narratives.  The impact of each account is inferred by its causal contribution to the overall narrative propagation over the entire network, which is not accurately captured by traditional activity- and topology-based impact statistics.  Impact estimation is based on a method that quantifies each account's unique causal contribution to the overall narrative propagation over the entire network. It accounts for social confounders (e.g., community membership, popularity) and disentangles their effects from the causal estimation using an approach based on the network potential outcome framework.  Because it is impossible to observe the both actual and potential outcomes, the missing potential outcomes must be estimated, which is accomplished using a model.  We demonstrate this approach's capability on real-world hostile IO campaigns with Twitter datasets collected during the 2017 French presidential elections, and known IO accounts disclosed by Twitter over a broad range of IO campaigns (May 2007 to February 2020), over 50,000 accounts, 17 countries, and different account types including both trolls and bots.  Our system classifies IO accounts and networks, and discovers high-impact accounts that escape the lens of traditional impact statistics based on activity counts and network centrality. Results are corroborated with independent sources of known IO accounts from US Congressional reports, investigative journalism, and IO datasets provided by Twitter.</p>

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Learning and Extrapolation in Graph Neural Networks</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a popular tool for learning representations of graph-structured inputs, with applications in computational chemistry, recommendation, pharmacy, reasoning, and many other areas. In this talk, I will show some recent results on learning with message-passing GNNs. In particular, GNNs possess important architectural properties and inductive biases that affect learning and generalization. Studying the effect of these inductive biases can be challenging, as they are affected by the architecture (structure and aggregation functions) and training algorithm, together with data and learning task. In particular, we study these biases for learning structured tasks, e.g., simulations or algorithms, and show how for such tasks, architecture choices affect generalization within and outside the training distribution.

This talk is based on joint work with Keyulu Xu, Jingling Li, Mozhi Zhang, Weihua Hu, Vikas Garg, Simon S. Du, Tommi Jaakkola, Jure Leskovec and Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi.</p>

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Learning by Transference in Large Graphs</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are successful at learning representations for network data but their application to large graphs is constrained by training cost. In this talk we introduce the concept of graph machine learning by transference: Training GNNs on moderate-scale graphs and executing them on large-scale graphs. To study the theoretical underpinnings of learning by transference we consider families of graphs converging to a common graph limit. This so-called graphon is a bounded symmetric kernel which can be interpreted as both a random graph model and a limit object of a convergent sequence of graphs. Graphs sampled from a graphon almost surely share structural properties in the limit, which implies that graphons describe families of similar graphs. We can thus expect that processing data supported on graphs associated with the same graphon should yield similar results. In this talk we formalize this intuition by showing that the error made when transferring a GNN across two graphs in a graphon family is small when the graphs are sufficiently large.</p>

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Graph Neural Networks are Dynamic Programmers</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: Recent advances in neural algorithmic reasoning with graph neural networks (GNNs) are propped up by the notion of algorithmic alignment. Broadly, a neural network will be better at learning to execute a reasoning task (in terms of sample complexity) if its individual components align well with the target algorithm. Specifically, GNNs are claimed to align with dynamic programming (DP), a general problem-solving strategy which expresses many polynomial-time algorithms. However, has this alignment truly been demonstrated and theoretically quantified? Here we show, using methods from category theory and abstract algebra, that there exists an intricate connection between GNNs and DP, going well beyond the initial observations over individual algorithms such as Bellman-Ford. Exposing this connection, we easily verify several prior findings in the literature, and hope it will serve as a foundation for building stronger algorithmically aligned GNNs.</p>

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Graph Constructions for Machine Learning Applications: New Insights and Algorithms</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: Graphs have long been used in a wide variety of problems, such as in analysis of social networks, machine learning, network protocol optimization or image processing. In the last few years, a growing body of work has been developed to extend and complement well known concepts in spectral graph theory, leading to
the emergence of Graph Signal Processing (GSP) as a broad research field. In this talk we focus on summarizing recent results that lead to a GSP perspective of machine learning problems. The key observation is that representations of sample data points (e.g., images in a training set) can be used to construct graphs, with nodes representing samples, label information resulting in graph signals, and edge weights capturing the relative positions of samples in feature space. We will first review how this perspective has been used in well known techniques for label propagation and semi-supervised learning. Then, we will introduce the non-negative kernel regression (NNK) graph construction, describe its properties, and introduce example applications in machine learning areas such as i) model explainability, ii) local interpolative classification and iii) self-supervised learning.</p>

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Distributed stochastic non-convex optimization: Optimal regimes and tradeoffs</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: In many emerging applications, it is of paramount interest to learn hidden parameters from data. For example, self-driving cars may use onboard cameras to identify pedestrians, highway lanes, or traffic signs in various light and weather conditions. Problems such as these can be framed as classification, regression, or risk minimization in general, at the heart of which lies stochastic optimization and machine learning. In many practical scenarios, distributed and decentralized learning methods are preferable as they benefit from a divide-and-conquer approach towards storage and computation at the expense of local (short-range) communication. In this talk, I will present our recent work that develops a novel algorithmic framework to address various aspects of distributed stochastic first-order optimization methods for non-convex problems. A major focus will be to characterize regimes where distributed solutions outperform their centralized counterparts and lead to optimal convergence guarantees. Moreover, I will characterize certain desirable attributes of distributed methods in the context of linear speedup and network-independent convergence rates. Throughout the talk, I will demonstrate such key aspects of the proposed methods with the help of provable theoretical results and numerical experiments on real data.</p>

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Principled Simplicial Neural Networks for Trajectory Prediction</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: We consider the construction of neural network architectures for data on simplicial complexes. In studying maps on the chain complex of a simplicial complex, we define three desirable properties of a simplicial neural network architecture: namely, permutation equivariance, orientation equivariance, and simplicial awareness. The first two properties respectively account for the fact that the node indexing and the simplex orientations are arbitrary. The last property encodes the desirable feature that the output of the neural network depends on the entire simplicial complex and not on a subset of its dimensions. Based on these properties, we propose a simple convolutional architecture, rooted in tools from algebraic topology, for the problem of trajectory prediction, and show that it obeys all three of these properties when an odd, nonlinear activation function is used. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of this architecture in extrapolating trajectories on synthetic and real datasets, with particular emphasis on the gains in generalizability to unseen trajectories.</p>

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Learning from Unreliable Labels via Crowdsourcing</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: Crowdsourcing has emerged as a powerful paradigm for tackling various machine learning, data mining, and data science tasks, by enlisting inexpensive crowds of human workers, or annotators, to accomplish learning and inference tasks. While conceptually related to distributed data and decision fusion, crowdsourcing seeks to not only aggregate information from multiple human annotators or unreliable (a.k.a. weak) sources, but to also assess their reliabilities. Crowdsourcing can thus be readily adapted to information fusion tasks in contested environments, where data may be provided from unreliable and even adversarial agents. Focusing on the classification task, exposition will include label aggregation, moments of annotator responses, dependencies of dynamic networked data, Gaussian Process-, and Deep Learning-based crowdsourcing demonstrated through extensive tests.</p>

</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: In the last years, processing signals defined over graphs has been a research topic that has attracted a lot of interest because of its widespread applications. Graphs are a simple example of a topological space, incorporating only pairwise relations. The goal of this lecture is to generalize graph signal processing to handle signals defined over more general topological spaces incorporating multiway relations of any order. In the first part of this lecture, I will start introducing simplicial and cell complexes as examples of spaces possessing a rich algebraic structure that facilitates the extraction of useful information from signals defined on them. I will motivate the introduction of a simplicial (or cell) Fourier Transform and show how to design filters and derive effective sampling strategies over a cell complex. Then I will present methods to infer the structure of the space from data. In the second part of the lecture, I will move to topological learning, describing the design of topological neural networks, operating on data living on a topological space. A number of applications will be presented to highlight the potentials of the proposed methods.</p>

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Graph adjacency spectral embeddings: Algorithmic advances and applications</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: The random dot product graph (RDPG) is a tractable yet expressive generative graph model for relational data, that subsumes simple Erdős-Rényi and stochastic block model ensembles as particular cases. RDPGs postulate that there exist latent positions for each node and specify the edge formation probabilities via the inner product of the corresponding latent vectors. In this talk, we first focus on the embedding task of estimating these latent positions from observed graphs. The workhorse adjacency spectral embedding (ASE) offers an approximate solution obtained via the eigendecomposition of the adjacency matrix, which enjoys solid statistical guarantees but can be computationally intensive and is formally solving a surrogate problem. To address these challenges, we bring to bear recent non-convex optimization advances and demonstrate their impact to RDPG inference. We show the proposed algorithms are scalable, robust to missing network data, and can track the latent positions over time when the graphs are acquired in a streaming fashion; even for dynamic networks subject to node additions and deletions. We also discuss extensions to the vanilla RDPG to accommodate directed and weighted graphs. Unlike previous proposals, our non-parametric RDPG model for weighted networks does not require a priori specification of the weights’ distribution to perform inference and estimation in a provably consistent fashion. Finally, we discuss the problem of online monitoring and detection of changes in the underlying data distribution of a graph sequence. Our idea is to endow sequential change-point detection (CPD) techniques with a graph representation learning substrate based on the versatile RDPG model. We share an open-source implementation of the proposed node embedding and online CPD algorithms, whose effectiveness is demonstrated via synthetic and real network data experiments.</p>

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Single view and Multiview Signed Graph Learning: Applications to gene regulatory network inference</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: In many modern data science applications, relationships between data samples are well described with a graph structure. While many real-world data are intrinsically graph-structured, there is a large number of applications, such as single cell gene expression data, where the graph is not readily available and needs to be learned from a set of observations, i.e. graph signals. Most of the existing work on graph learning considers homogeneous data, where all signals are assumed to be defined by a single graph structure, and undirected graphs. In this talk, I will introduce a framework for signed graph learning (SGL) using the following two assumptions. Signal values on nodes connected by positive edges are similar to each other, i.e., variation over positive edges is small, while signal values on nodes connected by negative edges are dissimilar to each other, i.e., variation over negative edges is large. From graph signal processing perspective, these assumptions correspond to graph signals being low- and high-frequency over positive and negative edges, respectively. Next, this framework will be extended to heterogeneous data that come from multiple related graphs introducing multiview signed graph learning (mvSGL). mvSGL learns multiple signed graphs jointly while regularizing the learned graphs to be similar to each other, where the similarity between different views is ensured through a consensus graph, which captures the common structure across views. The proposed framework is evaluated on both simulated real single cell RNA sequencing data.</p>

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Subgraph-based networks for expressive, efficient, and domain-independent graph learning</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: While message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) are the most popular architectures for graph learning, their expressive power is inherently limited. In order to gain increased expressive power while retaining efficiency, several recent works apply MPNNs to subgraphs of the original graph. As a starting point, the talk will introduce the Equivariant Subgraph Aggregation Networks (ESAN) architecture, which is a representative framework for this class of methods. In ESAN, each graph is represented as a set of subgraphs, selected according to a predefined policy. The sets of subgraphs are then processed using an equivariant architecture designed specifically for this purpose. I will then present a recent follow-up work that revisits the symmetry group suggested in ESAN and suggests that a more precise choice can be made if we restrict our attention to a specific popular family of subgraph selection policies. We will see that using this observation, one can make a direct connection between subgraph GNNs and Invariant Graph Networks (IGNs), thus providing new insights into subgraph GNNs' expressive power and design space. The talk is based on our ICLR and NeurIPS 2022 papers (spotlight and oral presentations accordingly).</p>

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Tractable Network Interventions For Large Socio-Technical Systems</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: Modern socio-technical systems involve a large number of nodes or agents interacting in heterogeneous ways. It is clear that interventions aimed at improving the performance or resilience of these systems should exploit information about the underlying network of interactions, yet most systems of interest are of very large dimension introducing several challenges for the design of network based interventions. In this talk, I will illustrate some of these challenges and possible ways to overcome them in the context of power and social networks.
First, motivated by applications in high voltage electric grids, I will discuss interventions aimed at ensuring robust synchronicity in networks of coupled phase-oscillators. Specifically, I will discuss how to optimal allocate network edge weights to minimize a measure of network  vulnerability proposed by Tyloo et. al, quantifying how much a small perturbation to a phase-oscillator's natural frequency impacts the system's global synchronized frequencies. I will show that this problem can be reformulated as a tractable semidefinite programming problem and I will illustrate how the obtained result can support optimal placement of renewable generation.
Second, I will consider diffusion processes in social and economic networks. In this case, the underlying network of interactions may be unknown, as collecting exact network data might be either too costly or impossible due to privacy concerns. Moreover, methods for designing optimal interventions, such as seeding, that rely on the exact network data typically do not scale well with the population size. To obviate these issues, I will introduce the tool of “graphon contagion” as a way to formally describe contagion processes in uncertain network settings and I will illustrate how this tool can be exploited to design seeding strategies that can be efficiently computed without requiring exact network data.</p>

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Graph Signal Processing for Neuroimaging: When Anatomy Meets Activity</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: State-of-the-art neuroimaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides unprecedented opportunities to non-invasively measure human brain structure (anatomy) and function (activity). To fully exploit the rich spatiotemporal structure of these data and gain insights into brain function in health and disorder, novel signal processing and modeling approaches are needed, instilled by domain knowledge from neuroscience and instrumentation. I will highlight one of our research avenues that leverages graph signal processing by integrating a brain graph (i.e., the structural connectome determined by diffusion-weighted MRI and tractography) and graph signals (i.e., the spatial activity patterns obtained by fMRI). The latter are decomposed onto a graph harmonic basis defined through the eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian. Spectral filtering operations are then designed to separate brain activity into its structurally aligned and liberal parts, respectively, which allows quantifying of how strongly function is shaped by the underlying structure. The structure-function strength throughout the brain uncovers a behaviorally-relevant spatial gradient from uni- to transmodal regions, which is also informative about task conditions or identifying individuals. Several promising ongoing and future research directions will also be featured.</p>

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Learning distances for attributed graphs with optimal transport</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: The obtention of good distances (or of metric) between objects is an important step for many Machine Learning or Data Processing methods. For structured data such as graphs, Optimal Transport (OT) has received much attention both from the ML community and from the Graph Signal Processing perspective. This especially allowed to address graph classification or graph transfer learning tasks. From our work, I will discuss two novel propositions that combine graphs (structure) and signals (attributes) using Optimal Transport for two situations:
i) a new OT-based distance, called Diffusion Wasserstein distance, that generalizes Wasserstein distance to attributed graphs thanks to the application of a graph filter (e.g. heat diffusion) combining structural and feature information, and that both provides a significant performance boost when solving graph domain adaptation tasks;
ii) a Metric Learning algorithm for OT-based distance between attributed graphs. Many Metric Learning algorithms have been developed in recent years, yet none for attributed graphs despite the interest of learning distances for better discriminating between graphs. We designed a novel Simple Graph Metric Learning (SGML) model, built from OT yet scalable and with few trainable parameters, that allows us to learn an appropriate metric from a set of labeled (attributed) graphs, so as to improve classification procedures.</p>

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Graphs for (multiple) data dichotomies</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: Traditionally, graphs in signal processing and machine learning have been constructed from data using a notion of similarity. Often it is useful to augment such constructions by incorporating the notion of an opposite (different polarity), which results in a (single) dichotomy. Some datasets, however, require multiple dichotomies (i.e., similarity/opposite in multiple data dimensions). In this talk, I will show how to deal with such data sets by using signed graphs and signature graphs. I will argue that for these types of graphs balance theory provides a natural and elegant framework for clustering and classification and I will discuss how to learn the topology of signed and signature graphs from given data.</p>

</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: Recent years have witnessed rapid transformations of contemporary advances in machine learning (ML) and data science to aid the transition of energy systems into a truly sustainable, resilient, and distributed infrastructure. A blind application of the latest-and-greatest ML algorithms to solve stylized grid operation problems, however, may fail to recognize the underlying physical grid models. This talk will introduce two examples of bridging physics-aware ML advances into efficient and resilient grid operations. First, we develop a topology-aware approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict the price and line congestion as the outputs of real-time AC optimal power flow (OPF) problem. Building upon the relationship between prices and topology, this proposed solution significantly reduces the model complexity of existing methods while being able to efficiently adapt to varying grid topology. The second example aims to design scalable emergency response policies of optimal load shedding during disastrous contingency of line failures. We have shown changes of localized measurements only can predict the marginal price of load shedding. The effectiveness of our approaches in predicting both normal and emergency operation actions have been validated using realistic power system test cases.</p>

</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: Graph-based signal processing and machine learning are recent techniques that have been developed to handle graph-structured data and have seen applications in such diverse fields as drug discovery, fake news detection, and traffic prediction. Despite the encouraging empirical results, a theoretical understanding of the robustness of these models against perturbation to the input graph domain has been lacking. In this talk, I will present our results on the stability bounds of spectral graph filters as well as other recent work on the robustness of graph machine learning models. A commonality of these studies is that they all share a topological perspective, that is, linking robustness to topological properties of the graph domain and perturbation. This contributes to a better understanding of robustness hence the deployment of graph-based models in real-world scenarios.</p>

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Simple Yet Powerful Graph-aware and Simplicial-aware Neural Models</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: Simplicial neural networks (SNNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as one the most popular machine learning models for processing and analyzing graph-structured data. SNNs learn low-dimensional embeddings of simplices in a simplicial complex by aggregating features of their respective upper, lower, boundary, and coboundary adjacent simplices. GNNs may be viewed as a specialization of SNNs, wherein the feature aggregations are limited to upper-adjacent nodes. The aggregation in SNNs or GNNs is usually carried out during training. Since the number of simplices of various orders in a simplicial complex is significantly large, the memory and training-time requirement in SNNs is enormous. In this talk, we discuss a scalable simplicial-aware neural network (SaNN) model with a constant run-time and memory requirements independent of the size of the simplicial complex and the density of interactions in it. SaNN is based on pre-aggregated simplicial-aware features as inputs to a neural network, so it has a strong simplicial-structural inductive bias. We provide theoretical conditions under which SaNN is provably more powerful than the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) graph isomorphism test and as powerful as the simplicial Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWL) test. We also show that SaNN is permutation and orientation equivariant and satisfies simplicial-awareness of the highest order in a simplicial complex. We demonstrate via numerical experiments that despite being computationally economical, the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting trajectories, simplicial closures, and classifying graphs.</p>

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Learnable geometric scattering and its applications to cellular and molecular data</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: Geometric deep learning has recently emerged as an increasingly prominent branch of machine learning. At the core of geometric deep learning is the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) in general, and graph convolutional networks (GCNs). However, recent work has shown the difficulty in generalizing these methods to more complex structures, identifying common problems and phrasing them in terms of over smoothing or under-reaching.  These issues can be partly attributed to the limited construction of convolutional filters in many commonly used GCN architectures. Recently, an alternative approach was presented to provide deep geometric representation learning by generalizing Mallat's scattering transform originally proposed to provide a mathematical framework for understanding convolutional neural networks, to graphs. Similar to traditional scattering, which can be seen as a convolutional network with non-learned wavelet filters, geometric scattering is defined as a GNN with handcrafted graph filters, typically constructed as diffusion wavelets over the input graph, which are then cascaded with pointwise absolute-value nonlinearities. First, we demonstrate the efficacy of geometric scattering features in graph processing tasks in both supervised learning in applications from molecular biology including drug discovery, viral RNA analysis. However, while graph scattering transforms provide effective universal feature extractors, their rigid handcrafted design does not allow for the automatic task-driven representation learning that naturally arises in traditional GNNs.  Here, our work has focused incorporating the richer, multi-scale and multi-frequency band features that geometric scattering frameworks into neural networks while still allowing them to be trainable end-to-end. In essence, we introduce a geometry scattering module which can be used as an architectural feature of a neural network, while still allowing for fully connected or other layers to be present in the network. Our module is called a “learnable scattering network,” which has properties inherited from the scattering transform while allowing the scales of the diffusion, and the laziness of the diffusion to be learned.  We show that our construction performs better on tasks that require whole-graph representations with an emphasis on biochemical molecular graphs, where relatively large diameters and non-planar structures usually limit the effectiveness of traditional GNNs. Further we show how to generalize scattering beyond the undetected graph setting to  directed graphs of genes, and point clouds, offering the possibility of deep learning on variable sizes of single cell data. We show preliminary results on patients measured at single cell resolution in terms of response to therapy, and outcome of infection.

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Regularity of graph neural networks</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have led to ground-breaking achievements in the applied sciences and industry. These achievements pose exciting theoretical challenges: can the success of GNNs be grounded in solid mathematical frameworks?

A GNN is a function that takes graphs (with node features) and returns vectors in R^n. Since the input space of a GNN is non-Euclidean, i.e., graphs can be of any degree and any topology, less is known about GNNs than standard neural-networks. In this talk, we claim that past theories of GNNs were missing an important ingredient: meaningful notions of metric on the input space, namely,  graph similarity measures that are defined for all graphs of any degree, which respect and describe in some sense the behavior of GNNs. We will show how to construct and analyze such graph metrics using graphon theory and Szemerédi's regularity lemma. This will show that GNNs behave regularly in some sense, which leads to generalization bounds, universal approximation theorems, expressivity results, and novel GNN designs.</p>

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Edge Varying Graph Neural Networks and Their Stability</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: Graph neural networks are de facto the machine learning tool for graph data. Recent years have seen a surge of interest in developing and analyzing novel architectures. Most of the time these solutions fall under the framework of a message-passing neural network, which despite popular groups only a part of the available solutions. In the first part of the talk, I will discuss an alternative general class of GNNs named EdgeNet, which unifies several other state-of-the-art graph neural networks (GNNs) through the concept of EdgeNet. An EdgeNet is a GNN architecture that allows different nodes to use different parameters to weigh the information of different neighbors. By extrapolating this strategy to more iterations between neighboring nodes, the EdgeNet learns edge- and neighbor-dependent weights to capture local detail. In writing different GNN architectures with a common language, EdgeNets highlights specific architecture advantages and limitations, while providing guidelines to improve their capacity without compromising their local implementation. In the second part, I will use the EdgeNet framework to analyze the stability of different GNN architectures to graph perturbations. I will discuss that (i) all GNNs within the EdgeNet framework are stable to topological perturbations and (ii) GNNs with fewer degrees of freedom in their parameter space, linked to a lower representational capacity, are more stable. With this analysis, I aim to shed light on the role of the graph topology in these results and to investigate a few handles we can consider when designing GNN architectures.</p>
