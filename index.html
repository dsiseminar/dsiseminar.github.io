</li>

<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: The weaponization of digital communications and social media to conduct disinformation campaigns at immense scale, speed, and reach presents new challenges to identify and counter hostile influence operations (IOs).  This talk presents the causal inference approach used as part of an end-to-end framework to automate detection of disinformation narratives, networks, and influential actors. The framework integrates natural language processing, machine learning, graph analytics, and a network causal inference approach to quantify the impact of individual actors in spreading IO narratives.  The impact of each account is inferred by its causal contribution to the overall narrative propagation over the entire network, which is not accurately captured by traditional activity- and topology-based impact statistics.  Impact estimation is based on a method that quantifies each account's unique causal contribution to the overall narrative propagation over the entire network. It accounts for social confounders (e.g., community membership, popularity) and disentangles their effects from the causal estimation using an approach based on the network potential outcome framework.  Because it is impossible to observe the both actual and potential outcomes, the missing potential outcomes must be estimated, which is accomplished using a model.  We demonstrate this approach's capability on real-world hostile IO campaigns with Twitter datasets collected during the 2017 French presidential elections, and known IO accounts disclosed by Twitter over a broad range of IO campaigns (May 2007 to February 2020), over 50,000 accounts, 17 countries, and different account types including both trolls and bots.  Our system classifies IO accounts and networks, and discovers high-impact accounts that escape the lens of traditional impact statistics based on activity counts and network centrality. Results are corroborated with independent sources of known IO accounts from US Congressional reports, investigative journalism, and IO datasets provided by Twitter.</p>

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Network GPS - A Perturbative Theory of Network Dynamics</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: Universal network characteristics, such as the scale-free degree distribution and the small world phenomena, are the bread and butter of network science. But how do we translate such topological findings into an understanding of the system's dynamic behavior: for instance, how does the small world structure impact the patterns of flow in the system? Or how does the presence of hubs affect the distribution of influence? In essence, whether its communicable diseases, genetic regulation or the spread of failures in an infrastructure network, these questions touch on the patterns of information spread in the network. It all begins with a local perturbation, such as a sudden disease outbreak or a local power failure, which then propagates to impact all other nodes. The challenge is that the resulting spatio-temporal propagation patterns are diverse and unpredictable - indeed a Zoo of spreading patterns - that seem to be only loosely connected to the network topology. We show that we can tame this zoo, by exposing a systematic translation of topological elements into their dynamic outcome, allowing us to navigate the network, and, most importantly - to expose a deep universality behind the seemingly diverse dynamics.</p>

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Connecting the dots: Leveraging GSP to learn graphs from nodal observations</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: The talk will provide an overview of graph signal processing (GSP)-based methods designed to learn an unknown network from nodal observations. Using signals to learn a graph is a central problem in network science and statistics, with results going back more than 50 years. The main goal of the talk is threefold: i) explaining in detail fundamental GSP-based methods and comparing those with classical methods in statistics, ii) putting forth a number of GSP-based formulations and algorithms able to address scenarios with a range of different operating conditions, and iii) briefly introducing generalizations to more challenging setups, including multi-layer graphs and learning in the presence of hidden nodal variables. Our graph learning algorithms will be designed as solutions to judiciously formulated constrained-optimization sparse-recovery problems. Critical to this approach is the codification of GSP concepts such as signal smoothness and graph stationarity into tractable constraints. Last but not least, while the focus will be on the so-called network association problem (a setup where observations from all nodes are available), the problem of network tomography (where some nodes remain unobserved, and which can be related to latent-variable graphical lasso) will also be discussed.</p>

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Signal processing on graphs and complexes</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: Graph signal processing (GSP) tries to device appropriate tools to process signals supported on graphs by generalizing classical methods from signal processing of time-series and images -- such as smoothing, filtering and supported on the nodes of graphs.  Typically, this involves leveraging the structure of the graph as encoded in the spectral properties of the graph Laplacian. In applications such as traffic network analysis, however, the signals of interest are naturally defined on the edges of a graph, rather than on the nodes. After a very brief recap of the central ideas of GSP, we examine why the standard tools from GSP may not be suitable for the analysis of such edge signals.  More specifically, we discuss how the underlying notion of a 'smooth signal' inherited from (the typically considered variants of) the graph Laplacian are not suitable when dealing with edge signals that encode flows.  To overcome this limitation we devise signal processing tools based on the Hodge-Laplacian and the associated discrete Hodge Theory for simplicial (and cellular) complexes.  We discuss applications of these ideas for signal smoothing, semi-supervised and active learning for edge-flows on discrete (or discretized) spaces.</p>

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Geometric Deep learning for Drug Discovery</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: Drug discovery is a very long and expensive process, taking on average more than 10 years and costing $2.5B to develop a new drug. Artificial intelligence has the potential to significantly accelerate the process of drug discovery by extracting evidence from a huge amount of biomedical data and hence revolutionizes the entire pharmaceutical industry. In particular, graph representation learning and geometric deep learning--a fast growing topic in the machine learning and data mining community focusing on deep learning for graph-structured and 3D data---has seen great opportunities for drug discovery as many data in the domain are represented as graphs or 3D structures (e.g. molecules, proteins, biomedical knowledge graphs). In this talk, I will introduce our recent progress on geometric deep learning for drug discovery and also a newly released open-source machine learning platform for drug discovery, called TorchDrug. </p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Speaker Bio</b>: Jian Tang is currently an assistant professor at Mila-Quebec AI Institute and also at Computer Science Department and Business School of University of Montreal.  He is a Canada CIFAR AI Research Chair. His main research interests are graph representation learning, graph neural networks, geometric deep learning, deep generative models, knowledge graphs and drug discovery. During his PhD, he was awarded with the best paper in ICML2014; in 2016, he was nominated for the best paper award in the top data mining conference World Wide Web (WWW); in 2020, he is awarded with Amazon and Tencent Faculty Research Award. He is one of the most representative researchers in the growing field of graph representation learning and has published a set of representative works in this field such as LINE and RotatE. His work LINE on node representation learning has been widely recognized and is the most cited paper at the WWW conference between 2015 and 2019.  Recently, his group just released an open-source machine learning package, called TorchDrug, aiming at  making AI drug discovery software and libraries freely available to the research community. He is an area chair of ICML and NeurIPS.</p>

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Modeling physical structure and dynamics using graph-based machine learning</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: This talk presents various ways complex physical objects and dynamics can be modeled using graph-based machine learning. Graph neural networks and Transformers have grown rapidly in popularity in recent years, and much of the progress has been driven by applications which demand representations and computations which are not well-supported by more traditional deep learning methods. Here we'll explore learning to simulate fluids and non-rigid materials, as well as learning probabilistic generative models of 3D objects and molecules, focusing on how the model choices and innovations were motivated by the structure of the problem and data. The goal of the talk is to emphasize the rich interface between graph-based machine learning and problems that arise in physical settings, and offer practical prescriptions for applying graph-based machine learning to other physical domains.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Speaker Bio</b>: Peter Battaglia is a research scientist at DeepMind. Previously he was a postdoc and research scientist in MIT's Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences. His current work focuses on approaches for reasoning about and interacting with complex systems, by combining richly structured knowledge with flexible learning algorithms.</p>

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Federated Learning in Big Data over Networks</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: Many important application domains generate distributed collections of heterogeneous local datasets. These local datasets are related via an intrinsic network structure that arises from domain-specific notions of similarity between local datasets. Networked federated learning aims at learning a tailored local model for each local dataset. We formulate networked federated learning using the concept of generalized total variation (GTV) minimization as a regularizer. This formulation unifies and considerably extends recent approaches to federated multi-task learning. We derive precise conditions on the local models as well on their network structure such that our algorithm learns nearly optimal local models. Our analysis reveals an interesting interplay between the (information-) geometry of local models and the (cluster-) geometry of their network.</p>
