<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: Drug discovery is a very long and expensive process, taking on average more than 10 years and costing $2.5B to develop a new drug. Artificial intelligence has the potential to significantly accelerate the process of drug discovery by extracting evidence from a huge amount of biomedical data and hence revolutionizes the entire pharmaceutical industry. In particular, graph representation learning and geometric deep learning, a fast growing topic in the machine learning and data mining community focusing on deep learning for graph-structured and 3D data has seen great opportunities for drug discovery as many data in the domain are represented as graphs or 3D structures (e.g. molecules, proteins, biomedical knowledge graphs). In this talk, I will introduce our recent progress on geometric deep learning for drug discovery and also a newly released open-source machine learning platform for drug discovery, called TorchDrug.</p>

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Network GPS - A Perturbative Theory of Network Dynamics</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: Universal network characteristics, such as the scale-free degree distribution and the small world phenomena, are the bread and butter of network science. But how do we translate such topological findings into an understanding of the system's dynamic behavior: for instance, how does the small world structure impact the patterns of flow in the system? Or how does the presence of hubs affect the distribution of influence? In essence, whether its communicable diseases, genetic regulation or the spread of failures in an infrastructure network, these questions touch on the patterns of information spread in the network. It all begins with a local perturbation, such as a sudden disease outbreak or a local power failure, which then propagates to impact all other nodes. The challenge is that the resulting spatio-temporal propagation patterns are diverse and unpredictable - indeed a Zoo of spreading patterns - that seem to be only loosely connected to the network topology. We show that we can tame this zoo, by exposing a systematic translation of topological elements into their dynamic outcome, allowing us to navigate the network, and, most importantly - to expose a deep universality behind the seemingly diverse dynamics.</p>

He then pursued his postdoctoral training at the Center for Complex Network Research at Northeastern University and at the Channing Division of Network Medicine, Harvard Medical School. Barzel is also an active public lecturer, presenting a weekly corner on Israel National Radio. His research focuses on the dynamic behavior of complex networks, uncovering universal principles that govern the dynamics of diverse systems, such as disease spreading, gene regulatory networks, protein interactions or population dynamics. Prof. Barzel is the recipient of the Racah Prize (2007) and of the Krill Prize on behalf of the Wolf Foundation (2019).</p>

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Connecting the dots: Leveraging GSP to learn graphs from nodal observations</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: The talk will provide an overview of graph signal processing (GSP)-based methods designed to learn an unknown network from nodal observations. Using signals to learn a graph is a central problem in network science and statistics, with results going back more than 50 years. The main goal of the talk is threefold: i) explaining in detail fundamental GSP-based methods and comparing those with classical methods in statistics, ii) putting forth a number of GSP-based formulations and algorithms able to address scenarios with a range of different operating conditions, and iii) briefly introducing generalizations to more challenging setups, including multi-layer graphs and learning in the presence of hidden nodal variables. Our graph learning algorithms will be designed as solutions to judiciously formulated constrained-optimization sparse-recovery problems. Critical to this approach is the codification of GSP concepts such as signal smoothness and graph stationarity into tractable constraints. Last but not least, while the focus will be on the so-called network association problem (a setup where observations from all nodes are available), the problem of network tomography (where some nodes remain unobserved, and which can be related to latent-variable graphical lasso) will also be discussed.</p>

<li><p><b>Title</b>: Signal processing on graphs and complexes</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Abstract</b>: Graph signal processing (GSP) tries to device appropriate tools to process signals supported on graphs by generalizing classical methods from signal processing of time-series and images -- such as smoothing, filtering and supported on the nodes of graphs.  Typically, this involves leveraging the structure of the graph as encoded in the spectral properties of the graph Laplacian. In applications such as traffic network analysis, however, the signals of interest are naturally defined on the edges of a graph, rather than on the nodes. After a very brief recap of the central ideas of GSP, we examine why the standard tools from GSP may not be suitable for the analysis of such edge signals.  More specifically, we discuss how the underlying notion of a 'smooth signal' inherited from (the typically considered variants of) the graph Laplacian are not suitable when dealing with edge signals that encode flows.  To overcome this limitation we devise signal processing tools based on the Hodge-Laplacian and the associated discrete Hodge Theory for simplicial (and cellular) complexes.  We discuss applications of these ideas for signal smoothing, semi-supervised and active learning for edge-flows on discrete (or discretized) spaces.</p>
